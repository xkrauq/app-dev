# HELLO, I AM DWIGHT, AND THESE ARE MY FAVORITE SERIES/MOVIES

**MOVIES**
1. Dead Poet Society
2. The Breakfast Club
3. A Ghost Story

> I love the movie Dead Poet Society because it made me realize that we should seize every moment. As per Mr. John Keating said, "Seize the day, gather ye rosebuds while ye may", as long as we can, we should, we must.

**SERIES**
1. The Boys
2. Peaky Blinders
3. Stranger Things

> I went for The Boys because it talks about how powerful persona can change and reshape the world/society to what they want or like. Applicable for these days...
